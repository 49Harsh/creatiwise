      question: "What is your design process?",
      answer: "My design process typically involves four key phases: research, design, prototype, and test. In the research phase, I gather insights about the user and their needs. In the design phase, I create wireframes and visual designs that meet those needs. In the prototype phase, I create interactive models of the design for testing. In the test phase, I collect feedback from users to refine the design."
    },
    {
      question: "What tools and software do you use for UX design?",
      answer: "I primarily use Figma for UI/UX design work, along with Adobe Creative Suite for graphics and visual elements. For prototyping, I use Figma's prototyping features and occasionally Framer for more complex interactions. I also use Miro for user journey mapping and collaborative ideation."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure the success of your UX designs?",
      answer: "I measure success through a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. This includes user engagement data, conversion rates, and task success rates. I also conduct user interviews and satisfaction surveys to gather direct feedback. The most important measure is whether the design solves the user's problem effectively and creates a positive experience."
